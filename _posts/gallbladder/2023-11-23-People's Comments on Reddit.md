## People's Comments on Reddit

I had mine out when I was 15 years old. It didn't suck at all, I had it removed via laproscope on a Wednesday, went home that day, and returned to school on Monday. Really, it was kind of no big deal. I felt perfectly fine by Monday and my diet is basically the same now as it ever was. Maybe a bit healthier now that I'm an adult, but I don't really take into consideration that I don't have a gallbladder when deciding what to eat.

I'm a man so I don't know how it'll affect you as a woman but the procedure itself was a piece of cake. I started to feel okay in about a week and was completely pain free in about a month.

Just don't rush your recovery. Even if you start to feel better in a few days, stay resting for as long as you can. I decided to clean the house while I was home on day 4 and the next morning I was in serious pain.

But, I can drink caffeine. In general the "what you can and cannot eat" is going to be unique to each person. Some people have zero restrictions and some have a million. You really won't know for a month, or more.

For me, it took about a week to be able to move around fairly well and a month to absolute recovery. I did gain some weight though, because I was finally able to eat food again. You'll gain four little scars on your belly, but you'll be fine.

I guess when they went to remove my gallbladder, it had already started leaking bile.

The recovery from surgery minimal (2-3 days rest at home in a recliner). Your diet doesnt change so much as its how your body process's food. Some greasy or really fatty food will make you have very loose liquid stools. Just be aware as you try different foods post -surgery you may need to go to the bathroom very soon after eating.

My pain was gone in less than two weeks but I definitely second what everyone else has said about resting a lot for at least a week. I have no dietary restrictions really but always ended up with a whole lot of diarrhea the morning after a night of drinking and greasy food

Healing from the scars is sort of hell. Waking up to take pain meds is critical. Other than that, piece of cake.

However, I had pancreatitis from my stones so getting mine out likely saved my life.

I had mine out in 2008. I checked into the hospital at 6 a.m. and I was home by noon. I was a bit groggy for the rest of the day and sore for maybe about a week afterward. The worst part was that my cat wanted to sleep on my stomach. There are three scars on my torso that you can only see if you know where to look.

The thing that sticks out the most in my mind is the doctor saying, "In two days, you're going to take the best poop ever." I just remember thinking it was the weirdest thing a doctor had ever said to me.

--
Another thing I remembered was that I was a bit bloated for a day or two after the surgery and my jeans fit funny. The doctor told me that was because they used air to move other organs out of the way.

I'm a med surg nurse and we see lap choles all the time. You should be out of the hospital within a day or two. Might get some IV antibiotics and some fluids. Overall it's the equivalent of getting your appendix out.

The one thing you need to do is walk. The surgeon will inflate your abdomen with CO2 and that can cause some gas pain in your left shoulder. Pain meds won't help, but walking does because the gas rises.

Good luck and get better soon!

I had mine out about three years ago! Procedure was not horrible, just a little scary because I had never had surgery before. My recovery wasn't bad, the third day was the hardest and then it got better.

--
After surgery, use all the pillows! Pillows everywhere!!! Belly, back, shoulders, everywhere!!!

I have an ultrasound scheduled next week to check for gallstones, what were your symtoms? I have an altered taste (bitter metal taste) in addition to pain and nausea. Have you, or anyone else, found that gallstones caused the >>metal taste<< in your mouth?

HIDA SCAN?
