#### I had my gallbladder removed six months ago, and I'm still having diarrhea. Is this normal?
Answer From Michael F. Picco, M.D.

Imodium

Studies have found that up to 20% of people undergoing gallbladder surgery develop diarrhea.

You may also consider limiting foods that can make diarrhea worse, including:
- Caffeine
- Dairy products
- Greasy foods
- Very sweet foods

The cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal isn't clear. 
Some experts believe that it results from an **increase in bile**, especially bile acids, entering the large intestine â€” *which may act as a laxative*.

Treatments you and your doctor may consider for controlling your diarrhea after cholecystectomy include:

Anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium A-D)
Medications that impair absorption of bile acids, such as cholestyramine

Talk to your doctor about your options and whether additional tests are recommended. Generally, 
mild diarrhea after cholecystectomy is not cause for concern,
