## Pain After Gallbladder Removal

from: https://surgicalassociatespa.com/why-do-i-still-have-pain-after-gallbladder-removal/

**You Are Eating Too Much**
Overeating after gallbladder removal is an easy way to end up uncomfortable while you heal. For the most comfortable recovery, **focus on eating smaller meals** that **do not take up too much space** or put too much pressure on you. Try **reducing your intake**, and see if that helps you to find relief. You can return to your standard eating habits after you heal.     

You Are Eating the Wrong Foods
Certain foods can cause problems after gallbladder removal. Although the list of safe foods your doctor gives can seem like a “best practices” option, it really is important to follow those guidelines. Ask your doctor what you can safely eat if you are experiencing discomfort. A change in diet may help.
