## Keep Your Liver Healthy

You can keep your liver healthy after gallbladder removal by eating a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting high-fat foods and alcohol, and engaging in regular exercise.

A good rule of thumb is to make sure you eat a healthy diet of fruits and vegetables, stay away from too many high-fat foods like fries or potato chips, avoid drinking much alcohol, and get regular exercise.

Avoid high-fat foods: Bile is needed to digest fat, so if you don't have a stockpile of bile, fat may cause digestive upset. 

Fiber is a vital part of healthy digestion, providing bulk that your digestive tract uses to move everything along. Good sources of dietary fiber include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains like brown rice and wild rice.
