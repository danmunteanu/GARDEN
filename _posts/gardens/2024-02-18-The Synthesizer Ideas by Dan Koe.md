A synthesizer is an **obsessive reality explorer**

understand that reality cannot be compartmentalized

A synthesizer is a **value creator**

A synthesizer is a **decentralized media company**.

The path of the synthesizer allows for the potential **to do what you enjoy**
  and earn as much money as you want doing it

your earning potential is dependent on 
- your **skill**,
