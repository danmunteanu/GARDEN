## Notes From Overcoming Scarcity (Pavlina)
- **Focus Attention differently**
- instead of focusing on the neediness and the lack and trying to get something going for yourself first? Before you can contribute?
- making contribution to other people
- having more fun in life, enjoying life, contribution to other people’s lives
- natural temptation is to focus on your own needs -> _uninspiring to other people_
=> Articles, volunteering, less time on own neediness
- be of a Contributing Mindset
- neediness is a habit, a Mindset
- help a contributor: I can Make a Difference in The World!
- meaningful, purposeful.
- blogging with the mindset of helping people
- doing some good work in the world
- extra appreciation for the work
- positive flow comes after adopting the contributor’s mindset
- focusing too much on trying to get for yourself? The mindset is the trap
- find some small way to help other people
- created backflow of good will and receiving
- share something to help others’ growing
