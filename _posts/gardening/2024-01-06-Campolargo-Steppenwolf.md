Whoever wants music instead of noise, joy instead of pleasure, soul instead of gold, creative work instead of business, passion instead of foolery, finds no home in this trivial world of ours.

From Steppenwolf


to learn to listen to the cursed radio music of life

to laugh at its distortions.


I gradually transformed into a Steppenwolf-like figure

a deeper connection to art, creativity, and meaning.

something profound and worth reflecting on.

Learning to listen to the cursed radio music 

more and more like the Steppenwolf, a lone wolf in a sea of noise
 
encouraging others to strive for a higher level of consciousness 

Henry David Thoreau.

I realized I didnâ€™t know how to revere the spirit behind it

Is the answer to go and live a life full of pleasure? Or is the answer to becoming a Steppenwolf who is too smart to engage but also too dumb to reverence and thus suffer a great deal

the lack of laughing, is the root of all diseases.

I must learn to find humor in even the darkest of situations.

I must not judge but listen carefully
