## Writing Template
TUFD = The Ugly First Draft

Show up and throw up. Write badly. Write as if no one will ever read it (Stephen King calls this 'writing with the door closed.'). Don't worry about grammar, complete sentences, or readability. Don't fret about spelling or usage, you'll tackle that all later. For now just get that TUFD down.
