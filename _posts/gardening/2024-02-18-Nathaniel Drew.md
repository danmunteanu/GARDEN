How the fuck do you find Real connection again?

There's so much mistrust in the world Today.

It is tempting to do what other people are doing.

does not continue the cycle of hate and violence.
slow down and engage even deeply with what we're doing.

It's so fucking hard not to get distracted.

This is the ultimate act of rebellion:
	To care about what you're doing 
	And to enjoy it.
