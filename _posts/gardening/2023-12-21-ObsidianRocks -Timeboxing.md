Source: [Planning Your Day In Obsidian By Timeboxing](https://obsidian.rocks/planning-your-day-by-timeboxing-in-obsidian/)

**Timeboxing** is the practice of **migrating your TODO list to your calendar**.

Instead of having long lists of tasks, you have allocated **_time slots_**

_time-slots_ are **focused sessions**

**Scheduled time** to **focus** on something of **interest**.

**Attention is the new currency**

We are all inundated with **information** 24/7

how does one **recapture focus**?

**ensure** our **attention** goes to **things we value** instead of on whatever is **new** and **shiny**

**focusing** on **something meaningful**
- get better at Ableton / FL Studio
- get **better** at any **creative pursuit**

**scheduling** an **hour** per **day**

I had no **system to force me** to **plan my day**.

*Day Planner* uses **military time**.
