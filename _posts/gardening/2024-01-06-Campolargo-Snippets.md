progress in my projects

having people who were once where you are

Some people call people like Paul “mentors,” but that word is overused and over-hyped 
I call them, My Future Selves.

little push you need

you get to talk to your future self

learn from their mistakes. 

you can also lose sight of the big picture of what you want

Future selves remind you

choosing a path that aligns with my interests and my goals. 

How To Find Your Future Self

Future selves can you show a path

You should be genuine
- Make yourself useful
- Ask unique and interesting questions
- DM or email them

Understand their motivations

can help him/her reach that potential

Don’t find mentors. 
- Finding people who are where you want to be. 
- Asking great questions, becoming genuinely interested in their work
- Keeping in contact with them, asking advice when you need it

I’m grateful to Paul and many of my other future selves

learn from their mistakes, pick a unique path for me

fresh perspective
