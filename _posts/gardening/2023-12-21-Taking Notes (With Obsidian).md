**structuring notes** with an eye towards **discoverability**.

You **create_atomic_notes** that **stand on their own two feet**, that aren’t_glued_to any other single resource.

how to capture information

keep a **simple list of books** I had read (that year)

Obsidian’s **linked nature**

**Jordan Peterson**’s_Beyond Order_

**Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated**

**C.S. Lewis**
- Fighting with yourself every day is hard. 
- Pursuing the good at all costs is hard. 
- Avoiding distraction is hard. 
- But that is the way to salvation, that is the way to a good life, and 
there’s no point putting it off until you’re old. 
- Fix yourself now, with any luck you can bring a bunch of other people along for the ride.

**Do not do what you hate.**

to follow your conscience and **live with the consequences**.

The consequences of following your conscience will always be better than the consequences of betraying yourself. 


*I’ve never read the full note. It’s too dense, too cluttered, too much work to figure out the long-lost **context***

The **worst type of note** is a note that **requires context to understand**

to **disconnect** the **idea** from the **book**

**atomic notes**

**code** that is**_reusable_**to a point where it **never needs to be written again**

If you’re not careful, you may end up **repeating yourself** again and again

**Atomic notes** are useful for **thousands of things**.

**Every new idea** gets a **new note**

those ideas are **no longer trapped** within a **single behemoth of a note**.

I created no fewer than**_sixteen_atomic notes** for this **248 page book**.

But because those **ideas weren’t_glued_to the book** itself, they have **continued to evolve** over the last year.

Here's An [[Example Note Taking]]

the **simple act of writing down** an_atomic note_

I’ve **returned to it several times** to **develop the idea**

**_high quality_notes** that **don’t bite off more** than they can chew.

*I took notes for every book I read* [...] and they have become a **tremendous asset**
