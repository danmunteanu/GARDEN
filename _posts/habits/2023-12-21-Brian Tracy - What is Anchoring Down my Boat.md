#### What is Anchoring Down my Boat?
- focusing on stuff that doesn't create the traction I want
- lack of **accountability**
- the vibe of the city around me
	- not on Friday-17-Nov
- commodity
- returning to the comfort zone
- re-engaging in old habits / activities
- being spread too thin - being focused on too many things at once
- not focusing on a project or multiple projects
- not having a **plan**
- not completing what I started (projects)
- not publishing 
- the absence of scheduling & planning
- consuming too much knowledge and taking too little action based on that knowledge
	- *Knowledge / Action ratio too high* or
	- *Action / Knowledge* ratio too low
- not focusing on Producing instead of *only* Consuming
