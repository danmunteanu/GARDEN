## What is Anchoring Down my Boat?

#### My Comfort Zone
- being too comfortable
- **running away** when **things get tough** or when **effort is required**
- returning to the comfort zone
- staying too much in the comfort zone
- engaging in **habits**, **activities** or **actions** that keep me in the comfort zone
- **expecting things to feel good** and **refusing to do** them if they don't

#### FOCUS
- not *having a project to focus on* (or multiple projects)
- being **spread too thin** - being focused on too many things at once
- focusing on stuff that doesn't **create the TRACTION** I want
- **focusing on** the vibe of the city around me
	- not on Friday-17-Nov
- **consuming too much** knowledge and taking too little action based on that knowledge
	- *Knowledge / Action ratio too high* or
	- *Action / Knowledge* ratio too low
- **not focusing** on **creating** and only **consuming** instead
- not **publishing** 

#### Scheduling & Planning
- the absence of **scheduling & planning**
- not having a **plan**
- lack of **accountability**
- **not completing** what I started (projects)
- **SOLUTION**: Have A Calendar
