*It looks like **the essence of it** is about **finding your voice** and **helping others find their voice too***

## Knowledge Workers

Huge increase in the importance of **knowledge workers**.

*The 8th habit is about **Self-Expression***

*Doing **work** that **focused on self-expression***

Focused on **self-expression**. 

At one time that meant making games. 
Now it means writing and speaking. 

I think I’d feel very stunted with a **career** that didn’t give me a sufficient **outlet for self-expression** 
- *I must create said outlet for **expression of Self***

*Covey is noticing the same thing — that **knowledge workers** perform best when their jobs contain an outlet for self-expression.*

### 7 Habits of Highly Successful People

The _7 Habits_ has a special place in my heart, since it’s one of the books that was influential in **helping me recover** from a **very low point in my life**. 

The **focus** on **character development** encouraged me to think about **what kind of man I wanted to be.**

I had to **learn the hard** way that other businesspeople don’t always “think win/win,” as I got better at **screening** for **like-minded people**

Covey left behind a **fabulous legacy of contribution**, influencing many individuals and businesses to think about **creating mission statements**.
## ACTION
