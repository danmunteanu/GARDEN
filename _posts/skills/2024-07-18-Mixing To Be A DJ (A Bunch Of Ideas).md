### What Does It Take To Mix On CDJ’s?

- No quantizing
- EQ-ing
- Know your songs
- Tons of practice
- Use fx sparringly
- hours upon hours of practice
- Quality music (320k or WAV)
- a cool t-shirt
- Dark Techno collection
- Quality headphones
- Long hours of music listening

### Phil Harris’ DJ Ideas
- Are you paid to be a DJ?
- Crowd is king.
- Watch the crown, play the music **they** enjoy.
- Better to be at a party that’s wild and play Elton John rather than at a Club playing house music people don’t enjoy.
- No one is watching the transition!
- _Filter Out – Volume Down – Press Play – Volume Up._
