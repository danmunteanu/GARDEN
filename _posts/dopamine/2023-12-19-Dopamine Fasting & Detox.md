The **things** that are **beneficial** for you **don’t give you the dopamine** compared to **phone**.

I got back to a place where I get a **HUGE HIGH** working on my business. I’m so pumped, can’t wait to work on it.”

Take your phone, **delete social media apps**, or **block sites** FOREVER. 
Stop using your phone. Put it on airplane mode. 
It is designed to be your **rat-gasm** dopamine button. 
It’s just as bad as cigarettes.

**Hard Dopamine Fast** over a weekend, light Food, good diet. 
Low-dopamine from diet. 

**Look at everything that gives you a dopamine hit** and get it out of my life.

**No more porn**.

About day 3 and 4 you’ll start enjoying **meditating**, **working** on your business… 

The brain will start finding Dopamine in those tasks.
