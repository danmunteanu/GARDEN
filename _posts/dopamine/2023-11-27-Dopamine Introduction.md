## Dopamine 
It is about **pursuit of things**
- Novelty
- Surprise
- Sense we're on some exciting track
- Puts us in states of **readiness**, **anticipation**, **looking**, **seeking**
- It's about **go go go**
- it's about **pursuit**

## Dopamine Hits 
- Just like an **animal in a corner** digging, **looking looking looking** for a bone - that's us
- After you get your **dopamine hit**, it shifts into something more like an OCD behavior
- Obsession leads to a **compulsion**
- **Acting out the compulsion** -> increase the **obsession**
- **Scrolling** -> why are you doing this?

## Random Intermittent Reward
- **keeps people doing** the **behavior**
- you don't know when you're gonna **hit the jackpot**
- just like **gambling**, you don't know when the next hit is gonna come

## Serotonine 
- does the **opposite of Dopamine**
- Satisfied, Satied
