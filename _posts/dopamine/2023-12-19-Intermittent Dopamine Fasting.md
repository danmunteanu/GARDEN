Intermittent dopamine fasting helps you do more "boring but high-value" activities more easily.

That's because "boring but high-value" low-dopamine activities such as...

Meditating
Reading
Writing
Working
Focusing
Facing fears
Connecting with people
Solving hard problems

Doing them becomes that much harder after you're already dopamine-triggered early on in your day.

DELAY the dopamine HIT as much as possible!
- **Coffee**

Anything below that threshold will not be as interesting

Think about it: Once you've had that dopamine hit early on from the news or Instagram, that tedious (but important) report you wanted to write is now utterly and mind-numbingly **boring**.

For example, if you check the news early in the morning, thus getting your first hit of dopamine, any tedious but important work like reading will just not be attractive anymore.

You just won't do it.

Because once you had that hit, you've created the minimum dopamine threshold for that day. Anything below that threshold will not happen.

However, if you can delay the first intense hit of dopamine for as long as possible, "boring" stuff like reading becomes much more attractive.

by delaying high-dopamine, low-value activities until the end of the day, they're not as rewarding/thrilling as when I do them in the morning

reading news is high on dopamine
