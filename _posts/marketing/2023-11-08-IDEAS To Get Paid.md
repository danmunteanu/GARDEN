Well, I gotta start someplace, don't I?

What are the actions that lead to getting paid, when it comes to writing?

## Writing (A Book)

Somebody buys the book

What leads to that? 
**AIDA** - Attention, Interest, Desire, Action

At a Bookstore:
	- **AWARENESS** person finds the book in a bookstore
	- **INTEREST** something catches the eye of that person
		- person becomes interested in the book OR
		- person wants to buy it as a Gift				
	- **DESIRE** person wants to buy the book
	- **ACTION** person takes the book to the cashier
	- **PAYMENT** person pays for the book and takes it home

Online:
	- person is browsing online shop
	- **AWARENESS** person either searches for book she saw in bookstore OR
	- **AWARENESS** person sees book suggested on site
	- **INTEREST** something catches the eye either from the description, or a hunch
	- **INTEREST** maybe there's a deal and the title is good, speaks to them
	- **ACTION** person places an order including the book
	- **PAYMENT** person pays for the order
		- either Online
		- upon receiving ORDER


**DESIRE + WANTING** is what leads to getting paid, WANTING. When somebody wants something and pays for it.

It's so simple - Want, Desire. That's it. Get. The desire to Have, to Get what is wanted. 

Desire.

Giving them something they want. Somebody wants something you have and buys from you. Period. That's what gets one paid. Exactly like in the game. 

*I have something someone else wants.* 

## What do I have that someone else wants?

How do I figure out? Publishing to the Simulator, that's how. Marketing myself. Making myself known, visible, available to **provide** a **product** or **service** that *someone else* **needs** or **wants** and is *willing to pay* for it.

**Cerere** și **Ofertă**

**Sales**. Having something to sell
## Precursor Actions
