Dopamine is about pursuit of things
- Novelty
- Surprise
- Sense we're on some exciting track
- puts us in states of readiness, anticipation, looking, seeking, 
- go go go
- all about Pursuit

dopamine hits transition into an OCD

animal in a corner digging, looking looking looking for a bone - that's us

After you get your dopamine hit, it shifts into something more like an OCD behavior
Obsession leads to a compulsion
Acting out the compulsion -> increase the obsession

scrolling -> why are you doing this?

Random Intermittent Reward - to keep people doing the behavior
-> you don't know when you're gonna hit the jackpot
just like gambling, you odn't know when the next hit is gonna come

Serotonine does the opposite of Dopamine
- satisfied, satied


## Dopamine Fast

Taken From:
https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/Dopamine+Fast+Introduction

The things that are beneficial for you don’t give you the dopamine compared to phone.

“I got back to a place where I get a HUGE HIGH working on my business. I’m so pumped, can’t wait to work on it.”

Take your phone, delete social media apps, or block sites FOREVER. Stop using your phone. Put it on airplane mode. It is designed to be your rat-gasm dopamine button. It’s just as bad as cigarettes.

Hard Dopamine Fast over a weekend, light Food, good diet. Low-dopamine from diet. Look at everything that gives you a dopamine hit and get it out of my life.

No more porn.

About day 3 and 4 you’ll start enjoying meditating, working on your business… The brain will start finding Dopamine in those tasks.

## Low-Value High-Dopamine Activities

super important to become more aware of what's grabbing my attention and running my life this way. 

The more I am aware of the mechanism, the more I can stay clear of them.

The problem is: They're all INCREDIBLY exciting by nature. That's what they do. They EXCITE. They're the epitome of excitement. These things are DESIGNED to trigger Dopamine release.

They're basically an insanely addictive, perfectly-designed

Scrolling through Youtube
Scrolling through Internet Porn
Sugar – Instant high
Coffee – Delayed high

## Intermittent Dopamine Fasting

From:
https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+Intermittent+Dopamine+Fasting
Intermittent dopamine fasting helps you do more "boring but high-value" activities more easily.

That's because "boring but high-value" low-dopamine activities such as...

Meditating
Reading
Writing
Working
Focusing
Facing fears
Connecting with people
Solving hard problems
become that much harder after you're already dopamine-triggered early on in your day.

DELAY the dopamine HIT as much as possible!
- Coffee

Anything below that threshold will not be as interesting

Think about it: Once you've had that dopamine hit early on from the news or Instagram, that tediuous (but important) report you wanted to write is now utterly and mindnumbingly boring.

For example, if you check the news early in the morning, thus getting your first hit of dopamine, any tedious but important work like reading will just not be attractive anymore.

You just won't do it.

Because once you had that hit, you've created the minimum dopamine threshold for that day. Anything below that threshold will not happen.

However, if you can delay the first intense hit of dopamine for as long as possible, "boring" stuff like reading becomes much more attractive.

by delaying high-dopamine, low-value activities until the end of the day, they're not as rewarding/thrilling as when I do them in the morning

reading news is high on dopamine
