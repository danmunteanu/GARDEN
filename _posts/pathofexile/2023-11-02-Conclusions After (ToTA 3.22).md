Path Of Exile Conclusions (After ToTA):

430h In-Game =~ 18d (since 1 September)

Since 1st September
- I've spent 18/81 days in-game
- I haven't accounted for the hours spent studing game-related information

Advice for future:
-> Focus on fewer characters 

What was totally worth it: (cost me 387h)
- Mysterion (EA) 247h
- Tornado Shock (TS) 53h30m
- Nakkonya (SRS) 35h
- Stappor (HXB) 51h30m
- YyLushka 23h

Builds with most potential:
- EA (Alt) - YyLushka
	- [x] Would have loved to play some more YyLushka.
- Tornado Shot -> 
	- [x] would have loved to get this to a higher level

What was definitely not worth it (30h)
- Teggonuk 3h30m
- RF_TheEternalFlameRising 4h
- NovoKayn 21h

I should have followed a build guide faster. It was fun to figure it out on my own at the start, but after I got angrier and angrier, I should have tried a guide faster.

Before September (previous league during summer), I played for 12d16h30m
