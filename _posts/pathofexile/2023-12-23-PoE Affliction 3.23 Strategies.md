- leveling Boneshatter **Apopsys** 77+ using Alva maps
- what I like is discovering how new builds work, following the guide and figuring out the build
- Best currency farming: Elementalist EA, farming T8-T12 max juiced maps
- Leveling Tornado Shot Build (BowMeena)
- Essences most profitable
- Expedition farming was ok between T8-T10, above T12 was really hard

## League Start Preps
- prepare regex
- list of lab trials
- list of quests that grant passives (/passives after completing campaign)- 

## Bosses
- [x] Eater (easy peasy)
- [x] Exarch (fuckin' fire balls)
- [ ] Maven
- [ ] Shaper
- [ ] Elder

## Maps
- Essence farming 
- ~~Harbingers~~
- Strongboxes - *careful, some explode, some freeze; on T16 they were fatal many times*
- List of Souls (For Pantheon)

## Checks After Campaign Completion
- [ ] Overcapping Resistances 75%+
- [ ] Stun and Block
- [ ] Chaos Res.
- [ ] Spell Suppression 100%
- [ ] Shock Immunity - Life Flask
- [ ] Freeze Immunity - Life Flask
- [ ] Corrupted Blood Immunity - Life Flask
