Anything below that threshold will not happen.However, if you can delay the first intense hit of dopamine for as long as possible, “boring” stuff like reading becomes much more attractive.by delaying high-dopamine, low-value activities until the end of the day, they’re not as rewarding/thrilling as when I do them in the morningreading news is high on dopamineWORK OFFLINE - 2H21 day-Publish Challenge"

    "content": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of the basic environment. Git also needs to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme:  Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.  GitHub Fork - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterSign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. GitHub ForkSign in to GitHub to fork Chirpy, and then rename it to USERNAME.github.io (USERNAME means your username).Next, clone your site to local machine. In order to build JavaScript files later, we need to install Node.js, and then run the tool:$ bash tools/init  If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will:  Check out the code to the latest tag (to ensure the stability of your site: as the code for the default branch is under development).  Remove non-essential sample files and take care of GitHub-related files.  Build JavaScript files and export to assets/js/dist/, then make them tracked by Git.  Automatically create a new commit to save the changes above.Installing DependenciesBefore running local server for the first time, go to the root directory of your site and run:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options:  url  avatar  timezone  langSocial Contact OptionsSocial contact options are displayed at the bottom of the sidebar. You can turn on/off the specified contacts in file _data/contact.yml.Customizing StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of it.Starting with version 6.2.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, copy the main sass file _sass/main.scss into the _sass directory in your site’s source, then create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new value.Customing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined by file _data/origin/cors.yml, and you can replace some of them according to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sAfter a few seconds, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using GitHub ActionsThere are a few things to get ready for.  If you’re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public.      If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, go the the root of your site and update the platform list of the lock-file:    $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux      Next, configure the Pages service.      Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar. Then, in the Source section (under Build and deployment), select GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu.        Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. In the Actions tab of your repository, you should see the workflow Build and Deploy running. Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically.  At this point, you can go to the URL indicated by GitHub to access your site.Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server."

    "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase---  The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;:  name: &lt;full name&gt;  twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt;  url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;                     # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;]   # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries.  The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax:  Block math should be added with $$ math $$ with mandatory blank lines before and after $$  Inline math (in lines) should be added with $$ math $$ without any blank line before or after $$  Inline math (in lists) should be added with \\$$ math $$&lt;!-- Block math, keep all blank lines --&gt;$$LaTeX_math_expression$$&lt;!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines --&gt;\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit.\"&lt;!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` --&gt;1. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$2. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$3. \\$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$MermaidMermaid is a great diagram generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }  For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right.  Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.      Normal position    Image will be left aligned in below sample:    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }            Float to the left    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }            Float to the right    ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }      Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image:  path: /path/to/image  alt: image alternative text---Note that the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image:  lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI---  You can observe LQIP in the preview image of post Text and Typography.For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value```  The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}  This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.VideosYou can embed a video with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.            Video URL      Platform      ID                  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-B46URT4mg      youtube      H-B46URT4mg              https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634779211      twitch      1634779211      Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts."
